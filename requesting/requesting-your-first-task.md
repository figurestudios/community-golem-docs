### Beginning to understand the system

##### Web Interface
Requesting your own task using commands can require a lot of prerequisites and also be hard - this is where [Slate](https://golem-slate.xyz/) comes in. [Slate](https://golem-slate.xyz/) offers a web-driven experience where you can request tasks in your browser, instead of having to deal with commands, keys, wallet addresses, faucets, and whatever else that might be a bit too complicated for someone starting out.

[Slate](https://golem-slate.xyz/) makes requesting really simple, and these 5 steps will show you how you can render a .blend file on Golem.

```css
1. Visit Slate at https://golem-slate.xyz
2. Click "Create a new SLATE".
3. Wait for Yagna to load.
4. Click the "Run" icon.
5. Watch the logs appear and the output to generate.
```

If you had a hard time going through the instructions you can see a video demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtcffGY5asY), where everything is explained.
##### Command-Line
The previous example showed you how easy it was to render a .blend file on Golem using Slate.

If you want to do the same, but using commands, feel free to check out [a quick primer](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development) example from the handbook which utilizes commands.), which can be used by a bit more advanced users who feel comfortable using commands.
### Advancing
This guide is mainly using [Slate](https://golem-slate.xyz/) as to not scare non-developers away, but if you're interested in making your own applications you could check out our [developer guide on your first application](https://github.com/figurestudios/community-golem-docs/blob/main/developing/creating-your-first-app.md).

This guide is currently put on hold as [Slate](https://golem-slate.xyz/) is not yet supporting Python nor Javascript request scripts, but will receive an update once the [developer guide](https://github.com/figurestudios/community-golem-docs/blob/main/developing/creating-your-first-app.md) is finished.

For now, if you want to advance, you must follow the [handbook](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development) and learn the command-line interface
