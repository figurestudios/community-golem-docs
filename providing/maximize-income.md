## Background
Today, making money with a spare computer is a dream come through - especially if it's by earning passive income on renting out your computer.
Lots of people have spare PCs, but not a lot of people know that you can utiilze them for profit.
Whether it's CPU-mining, GPU-mining or other ways to get 'free' crypto-currency - this guide is for you!

### Why Golem isn't enough (yet)
Right now, most people gets maximum a few tasks per day. [Golemstats](https://golemstats.com/) shows, at the time of writing, that 511 providers has split $59.25 USD the past 24 hours. That's not nearly enough for most people.
That said, most providers have their servers basically idling if they only use Golem - as the tasks can, if you're lucky, let you compute for an hour a day at the current state of adoption.
This is why there is a need for more than just providing for Golem at its current adoption state.

### The solution
Golem only utilizes CPU, RAM, and storage for now. That leaves bandwidth and GPU - making you able to run the [Banano Miner](https://bananominer.com/) on Folding@Home or mining Ethereum for GPU, and [Mysterium](https://mysterium.network/) or running a [Theta Node](https://www.thetatoken.org/).

Because of the fact that Golem only computes for a few minutes/hours per day, you can also set up the Banano Miner on your CPU, or mining something like [PKT](https://pkt.cash/mining/).

But be careful. If you still want to provide for Golem you should make sure that the Golem client has a higher priority than mining.

## List of nodes
### CPU
[Golem providing](https://github.com/figurestudios/community-golem-docs/blob/main/providing/provider-setup.md), [Banano Mining](https://bananominer.com/), [PKT-mining](https://pkt.cash/mining/), and other [CPU-mineable coins](https://emozzy.com/what-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-mine-with-cpu/).

### GPU
[Banano Mining](https://bananominer.com/), [NiceHash Mining](https://www.nicehash.com/), [Ethereum Mining](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/how-to-mine-ethereum.html).

### Storage
[Sia](https://support.sia.tech/hosting/how-to-host-on-sia), [Storj](https://www.storj.io/node), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/#install).

### Bandwidth
[Mysterium](https://mysterium.network/), [Theta](https://www.thetatoken.org/).
