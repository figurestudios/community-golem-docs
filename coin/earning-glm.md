# Earning GLM Tokens

### Disclaimer
There's no such thing as garuanteed GLM - unless you purchase them. You will either need luck, skill, dedication, or a combination of them to make more. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose and keep to the free programs if that's an issue.

### Bounties, Programs & Hackathons
##### Providing on an already-used PC/Server
If you have a PC or server you're already using for other stuff, you could earn GLM on the idle resources you have - by letting others use it!

You can see how much other people are/have earned [here](https://golemstats.com) to get a clear picture on how profitable it is - just keep in mind that most providers provide 24 hours per day.

To become a provider, please refer to the guide on [setting up a provider node](https://github.com/figurestudios/community-golem-docs/blob/main/providing/provider-faq.md#setting-up-a-provider-node).

##### Hackathons
If you're a developer and want to experiment with Golem - this is it;

You'll be able to compete for big prizes (for reference, last hackathon had prizes totaling $30k USDc) - simply by making an application that provides value, innovation and ease-of-use on Golem!

To find on-going Golem hackathons, check [this](https://gitcoin.co/golemfactory/bounties) page out.

### Risky Ways
##### Investing in hardware
Investing in hardware can make you earn GLM by [becoming a provider node](https://github.com/figurestudios/community-golem-docs/blob/main/providing/provider-faq.md#setting-up-a-provider-node), but you may also lose in server operational costs, utility costs, and other expenses. 

Do your own calculations before starting as if you don't know what you're doing, you can buy overpriced hardware, lose in the long-term or rack up thousands of dollars of server costs if you don't know what you're doing.

##### Providing Liquidity
Providing Liquidity is where you hold 2 coins and allow users to buy/sell these 2 coins automatically. You earn your cut by having a small commission to the transaction - giving you a % of each trade. The % varies depending on which portal you're using, and the risk too.

You can read more details on providing liquidity [here](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/core-concepts/pools/).

Get started on Uniswap v1 by:
```
1. Login to Uniswap.
2. Click on 'Pool'
3. Click on 'Join a pool'
4. Search for your desired pool.
5. Click on 'Add Liquidity'.
6. Enter the value in either coin in the input fields.
7. Click 'Supply' and confirm.
```
Get started on Uniswap v2 by:
```
1. Visit Uniswap v2.
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Head to the 'Pool' section.
4. Click 'Create Exchange' in the drop-down field.
5. Paste the contract address.
6. Click the 'Join Pool' and confirm.
```

You can find the contract address on [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io).

Keep in mind that it's not risk-free. UniSwap has a [page](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/advanced-topics/understanding-returns/) where they explain the risks you're opening yourself up against.

##### Trading
Trading is super risky and most traders lose a lot when first starting out. Do your own research and envaluate the risks yourself.

You can swap your GLM & other coins over & over again if you want to try beat the market.

If you want to bet on GLM's price, you could try margin trading.

The exchanges where you can trade GLM can be found [here](https://glm.golem.network/).
